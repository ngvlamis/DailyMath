### About
DailyMath is a collection of math worksheets that are auto-generated daily to provide students an opportunity to strengthen their math fluency.
(See the Philosophy subsection of the website for more details.)

### Code Information

- The site is static, with the static html files and required subfolders living in the root folder.
    The site is hosted by GitHub Pages.
    <br>

- The site is generated by Jekyll, with the code in the `WebsiteGenerator/` subdirectory.
    To generate the static files, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` while the current working directory is `WebsiteGenerator/`.
    Information on installing Jekyll can be found on the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com).
    The website components are built using [Bootsrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com). 
    In the root directory, you can then run `python regenerate_dailymath_website.py` to copy the `WebsiteGenerator/_site/` directory to the root directory, thereby updating the site.
    <br>

- To regenerate the worksheets, run `python DailyMath_Worksheet_Generator.py` in the `WorksheetGenerator/` directory.
    Generating the worksheets requires (1) the `pyyaml` library, which can be optained via pip (`pip install pyyaml`) and (2) a local installation of [Tex Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)&mdash;the minimual installation is not enough as the "fontsize" package is not included in the minimal install.
    <br>

- Information on each type of worksheet is stored in the YAML file `WebsiteGenerator/_data/worksheets.yml`.
    Both the python script used to generate websites and the code used to list the worksheets on the website rely on the data in this YAML file.
    <br>

- The bash script ``generate_worksheets_and_commit.sh`` is used generate new worksheets and commit them to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository.
    On my end, this script runs every night at 2am on a local Raspberry Pi to create new worksheets daily.
